This is Shiki (spelled as Siqi, but Shiki is easier to pronounce in English), a math student interested in machine learning and data science. The purpose of this blog is to share solutions to some technical problems I have encountered, as well as study notes I compiled or found. They are mainly for my own reference. However, I would be more than happy if they could help those who come across similar issues.
